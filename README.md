# Frontend Mentor - GitHub user search app solution

This is a solution to the [GitHub user search app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about API and fetching, and it was a good refresher on the basics of the language. Moreover, I learned how to use the `prefers-color-scheme` CSS property to determine the color scheme of the user's browser.

### Continued development

I want to improve more on my Javascript and CSS skills. I found that my code could have been more refined if I had more experience with the language.
